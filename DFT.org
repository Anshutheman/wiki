* DFT Basics
Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a reformulation of the traditional Schrodinger equation approach to quantum mechanics. It describes the ground state properties of a system in terms of the electron density. This page will not attempt to serve as a tutorial for understanding DFT, but rather to point the interested person to useful resources where he/she can find more information on a topic.
